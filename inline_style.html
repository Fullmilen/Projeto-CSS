            Puppy was as little as a puppy could be when he moved for the 
            first time. He watched as they packed up his bag with his toys 
            and blanket. | © Savannah Hendricks
            
            CARMODY: You know, sometimes my moods just rise and fall like the 
            flags up there on the two hotels; a little wind and my flags are 
            up! | © Charles D. Tarlton
